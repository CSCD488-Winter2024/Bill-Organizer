# Bill Organizer

Bill organizer is a web service built off of Python 3 that gathers information from the Washington State Legislature
about upcoming bills, to notify users of upcoming meetings, track and manage metting times and syncronize meetings to 
the user's phone, and export current bill information in useful file formats.
